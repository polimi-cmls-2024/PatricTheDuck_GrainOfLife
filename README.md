# Grain of Life: A Computer Music System

## Overview
**Grain of Life** is a computer music system that generates mesmerizing soundscapes using granular synthesis influenced by Conway's Game of Life. The project involves three main components:

1. **Interaction Unit**: Uses an Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi and a joystick to capture user inputs and control the initial and evolving state of the Game of Life.
2. **Computer Music Unit**: Implements granular synthesis using SuperCollider and enhances audio with VST plugins developed in JUCE.
3. **Graphical Unit**: Provides visual feedback to users via Processing.

## Components

### 1. Granular Synthesis with Conway’s Game of Life
- **Game of Life**: A cellular automaton where cells on a grid live, die, or reproduce based on specific rules.
- **User Interaction**: Users set initial conditions and can modify the evolution of the Game of Life using a joystick. This interaction influences the sound generated by the granulator.
- **Chosen Pattern**: The 2-glider mess pattern is used for its controlled yet dynamic evolution.

### 2. Interaction Unit: Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi
- **Hardware**: Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi with a joystick module v2.
- **Functionality**: The joystick controls the position and dropping of the 2-glider mess pattern on the grid, allowing real-time interaction.

### 3. SuperCollider Mapping
- **Granular Synthesis**: Implemented using the GrainBuf UGen in SuperCollider.
- **Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters such as number of channels, grain duration, playback rate, position, panning, and envelope buffer.

### 4. VST Plugins
Developed with JUCE, the system includes four plugins to enhance audio:

#### 4.1 Reverb

### 5. Routing
- **Audio Routing**: Uses BlackHole (MacOS virtual audio loopback driver) to route audio from SuperCollider to a DAW where it is processed by the VST plugins without added latency.

## Conclusion
**Grain of Life** creates unique soundscapes through the interaction of granular synthesis and the evolving patterns of Conway's Game of Life, augmented by user inputs and enhanced by custom VST plugins. This system is ideal for creating immersive audio experiences for art installations.
